# ALLVALID
You all know Wordle, right? (If not, look it up.) And if you know about Wordle, you probably know of its many derivatives. In fact, judging by the website you're on, I bet you’d even want to or are making one yourself! The thing is, one of the Wordle rules is that each guess has to be a “valid” 5-letter word. Now, determining what is a valid word is extremely hard, and the general consensus seems to be that a word is a word when “people” say it is. But who are these people? Dictionaries? *Why can’t it be us?* And if it is us, why don’t we go wild with it? 

That’s why I’m starting a movement: ALLVALID. ALLVALID seeks to create a word list where **every single five-letter word is valid.** That’s right, all 11,881,376 words will be included, with a reason for each. Proper nouns? Slang? Acronyms? Abbreviations? Words made up the other day? All valid for inclusion, although more “mainstream” reasons (i.e. in a conventional dictionary) are preferable to more “outsider” reasons. We’ll compile them into a text document and make it freely available. Wordlelikes will no longer have to check with forever-incomplete word lists; just say your Wordlelike is ALLVALID-compliant! Join us today, and make a future where words are ALLVALID.
